These are not affiliate links.\nGodel, Escher, Bach\n[https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567] -\nThe best book I have ever read. This book blew my mind. Many times. It also won\na Pulitzer. It's not an easy read, but it is beautifully written. It's also\nhighly recommended by Eliezer Yudkowsky.\n\nThe Beginning of Infinity\n[https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359] \n- This book is the most important one on the list. It covers everything from the\ntheory of progress to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and it\nchanged my worldview more than any other. It's beloved by many of the smartest\npeople I know of (including Patrick Collison, and Naval Ravikant).\n\nThe Dream Machine\n[https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop-ebook/dp/B07GBCX7YC/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+dream+machine&qid=1624323165&s=books&sr=1-1] \n- A wide-ranging history of the internet that is both informative and\nentertaining, The Dream Machine is the best history book I've ever read. It also\ntaught me more about information theory than my computer science degree, without\nonce sounding like a textbook. Despite clocking in at over 500 pages, it's hard\nto put down once you get started. Also recommended by Patrick Collison.\n\nMore Money than God\n[https://www.amazon.com/More-Money-Than-God-Relations/dp/0143119419] -  This one\nbeats out stiff competition to take the title of best finance book I've read.\n(Sorry, Michael Lewis). More Money than God is nominally a history of hedge\nfunds, but you'll find it much more engaging than that description might\nsuggest. Much like The Dream Machine, it strikes a balance between storytelling\nand explanation. Also, Paul Graham once recommended this book on Twitter. \n\nZero to One\n[https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=zero+to+one&qid=1624510123&s=books&sr=1-1] \n- This book is basically the startup Bible. Everyone in Silicon Valley has read\nand recommends this book. They're not wrong. It really is that good. \n\nWhere is My Flying Car\n[https://www.amazon.com/Where-My-Flying-Car-Memoir-ebook/dp/B07F6SD34R/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=where+is+my+flying+car&qid=1624510213&s=books&sr=1-1] \n- This book deserves a blog post (or several) in its own right. It explores the\ncauses and effects of the Great Stagnation\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Stagnation] through the lens of flying\ncars. One key culprit - energy stopped getting cheaper in the 1970s. Why? You'll\nhave to read the book and find out. (Or, if you're in a hurry, you can find a\ngreat summary here [https://rootsofprogress.org/where-is-my-flying-car]). Balaji\nSrinivasan tweets about this book a lot. \n\nSurely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\n[https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Youre-Joking-Mr-Feynman-ebook/dp/B003V1WXKU/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=surely+youre+joking&qid=1624510687&s=books&sr=1-2] \n- An autobiography of Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman. Full of\n outrageous shenanigans and half-cocked exploits, it's a wonderful reminder that\nworking hard and having fun are not mutually exclusive. This one is an easy\nread, and it's been recommended by everyone and their mother.","html":"<p>Hey, I'm Preston.
